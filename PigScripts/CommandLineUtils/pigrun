#! /bin/bash

# Runs pig with the given pig file. Prints the
# elapsed clock time at the end. Any Pig parameters
# passed into this script from the command line 
# are passed to Pig. The last command line parameter
# must be the script to run.
#
# Passing named parameters to the Pig script: 
#
#    Some Pig scripts require or optionally take named parameters
#    with values. These are documented with the Pig scripts.
#    Such parameters should be entered on the command line
#    like this: <parameterName>=<parameterValue>
# 
# Examples:
#     pigrun myScript.pig
#     pigrun fileName=/home/myname/data.csv myScript.pig
#     pigrun age=25 gender=female makeProfile.pig
#
# Customization of this script to your environment:
#     Any jar files needed by the script, other than 
#     piggybank.jar is assumed to be in PIG_USER_JAR_DIR
#     You can change this variable below.
#
# Environment assumptions:
#     $PIG_HOME is set to point to the Pig installation

PIG_USER_JAR_DIR=/home/paepcke/contrib

# Start building the eventual Pig command:

PIG_COMMAND="-param USER_CONTRIB=$PIG_USER_JAR_DIR"

# For each argument, other than the script name,
# we pre-pend '-param', which is how Pig expects
# paramters to be passed in. Example:
#    pigrun age=35 myScript.pig
# becomes: 
#    -param age=35 myScript.pig

# Finally, append the Pig script name to the command:

PIG_COMMAND="${PIG_COMMAND} ${PIG_SCRIPT_NAME}"

# And run the command:

# -v: see the Java backtraces on the console, not just in the log file.
# -l <dir>: log file directory
# -f: the Pig script file to execute
# -p: properties file to use:

/usr/bin/time --format="Runtime (m:ss.millisec): %E" \
   $PIG_HOME/bin/pig -Dpig.usenewlogicalplan=false -v -logfile Logs ${PIG_COMMAND}
